A WebSocket server for "BASH".

Usage: ncat -l [-k] -p 1337 -e echo.sh  (or install as an CGI)

Currently it's just a (broken) echo server, since I don't at all feel like
implementing the framing mechanism from latest (final) WebSocket standard.
And it's broken, since we echo back masked frames, whereas standard[1] says:

   ... A server MUST NOT mask any frames that it sends to
   the client.  A client MUST close a connection if it detects a masked
   frame.  (5.1. Overview)

However, both tested browsers accept masked frames.

Should work in Google Chrome 14+, Firefox 7+ and IE 10+.
Tested to work in Chrome 16 and Firefox 9.
